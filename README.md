A reclusive Marine meets his match with a hungry journalist...

Ryan Stone was once called a leader of men. But since leaving the military minus two fingers and a good chunk of his thigh, he’s barely seen or spoken to a human in nearly a year. In the mountains of Wyoming, he’s more than happy with his solitary, off-the-grid lifestyle. So when a certain interfering and crazy-hot photojournalist drops back into his life, he’s shaken by memories of another time and place.

Livvy has survived under extreme conditions to capture the best stories on film. But one battle-zone moment haunts her th

Title: Can a worldwide photographer find love with a solitary mountain man?
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2020
Review: I love all of Em Petrovas books. All have great character development. Great stories. Ryan is a wounded soldier. Closing himself off from people seems to be how he copes with his demons. Until Livvy climbs his mountain to thank him for saving her life. Pushing into his world. But he’s grumpy and sullen. And seems less than happy to see her. Can Liv crack that wall Ryan has around his heart? Great story. Would loved to have learned more about both characters but hope they show up in future books.

Review: Alpha, prideful man needed a slap upside the head. One minute he recognized how strong Livvy was and next breath he's got to save her and take her decisions away from her. UGH! Thank goodness she's also VERY STUBBORN.

Review: Living on a mountain top takes a lot of work. Ryan knows this first hand and loves his solitude. That's until Livvy decides to find him and show him just how lonely he really is. This is a good story about healing and love.

Review: They met in Afghanistan and both felt that pull towards each other, an explosion separated then until a year later she tracked him down to thank him for saving her life. What happens next you really have to read for yourselves! A great book, I highly recommend it.

Title: Something About a Mountain Man - Romance, Suspense, Drama and Really Droolworthy!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2018
Review: A story of good and bad - of war and peace. The attraction between Ryan and Livvy is evident when Livvy finds Ryan to thank him for saving her life in Afganistan but at a great cost to his own. When she finds him homesteading in the mountains, scarred and in both emotional and physical pain, the emotions run wild between them - such raw rurmoil and sexual tension! Once these two start to roll they roll to perfection in the passion mode. They have very conflicting emotions on how they feel for one another and neither will admit to loving each other. The anticipation and longing between Ryan and Livvy are tangled up in the intimacy. There is anguish and tears in the book - so beware - have tissues ready! The want to protect and the want to keep the love between these two is great. Will they be able to stay together? To give up dreams and make new ones? Only time can tell. A total love story with lots of steamy, hot sex! Bringing in the story of another homesteading family and their children was a great twist. Em Petrova never fails to satisfy in all her books, in every series. You feel so many emotions and it does not stop until the very end when you have the urge to read it again! Enjoy ... Super great read! I received a free copy of this book and voluntarily chose to review it.

Title: Is passion and love enough to keep Livvy with Ryan on the mountain?
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2018
Review: Something About a Mountain Man is the fourth book in the Wild West series. In between wild photography shoots, Livvy travels into the mountains to find an old friend, Ryan, to thank him for saving her life. Ryan fled to the mountains to escape people, and the last person he expects to see is Livvy. But soon their passion overflows and one night turns into weeks of living together, bonding, and loving. But is it enough to keep Livvy with him on the mountain?

Oh my goodness, I loved this book! It was sweet, romantic, steamy, but I absolutely loved Livvy and Ryan. Livvy was so cultured, knowledgeable about living through the land, and so caring. Her heart was so big and warm. Ryan was a mess of hurt emotions from the past and trying to protect his heart now, but he also showed his caring side often. They were such a great match for each other, accepting their personalities and flaws, and their love quickly grew. I have loved all of the books within this series, but this may have been my favorite. I highly recommend Ms. Petrova and this series!

Title: I loved this book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2018
Review: I really enjoyed this book. I liked both the characters, from their good parts to the bad.

My heart felt like it was on a roller coaster when it came to Ryan Stone. One minute he broke my heart and all I wanted to do was cuddle him and then the next moment he would do something dumb and I would want to throat punch him. After a tough mission, Ryan decided that he would like to live a simpler life so he heads up to the mountain away from civilization. A year later the one person who could shake up that quiet world shows up at his door. He tries everything to get her to leave but the pull is too strong.

I loved that character of Livvy, so much so I was a little envious of her. This woman was fearless. She was someone who has seen some of the worst of the worst and yet she was a very happy and carefree type of person. She seemed like someone I would want to hang around with. I like that she was kind and warm to Ryan but yet was willing to call him on some of the things he said or did. I admired her!!

I really enjoy this series!
